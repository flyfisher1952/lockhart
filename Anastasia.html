							Anastasia
						</h2>
						<p>
							Anastasia is our daughter who we adopted in Kerch, Independent Republic of Crimea,
							<a href="ukraine.html">Ukraine</a> on December 24, 2001. She has pretty brown eyes
							and hair and a lovely light olive complexion. She's very smart and began reading
							<img alt="" src="images/gallery/2006-11-30-ana.JPG" style="float: left; padding: 10px; border: 0; height: 220px;" />
							writing and speaking English within a month of bringing her home. Ana is very happy
							most of the time and likes to sing and dance. When we first brought her home, she
							sang in Russian. She no longer remembers Russian, but is trying to re-learn it
							lately.
							<img alt="" src="images/Ana-dec-2011.jpg" style="float: right; padding: 10px; border: 0; height: 500px;" />
							Ana is a wonderful blessing for our family and has increased the love in our home. Her
							brothers love her dearly and she brings her special spirit where ever she goes. Ana
							was in the orphanage at Kerch from March, 2000 to December 2001 when we adopted her.
							She's the biological daughter of Sergey Dimitriyevich and Anna Nickolayevna Ocipova
							who are both deceased. Her mother, Anna, died of 5th degree burns (Russian scale)
							on October 21, 1999 at the age of 42. Her father, Sergey, died at 39 of stenosis
							coronary sclerosis on March 7, 2000. According to Maxim, Ana's next older brother
							who was also at the Kerch orphanage, he worked as a fisherman.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ana was the youngest of 5 children, 2 girls and 3 boys. At the time that we adopter
							<img alt="" src="images/gallery/ana-cheer-2010-0ct-preview.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 10px; border: 0; " />
							her, her youngest brother, Maxim, was 13 and the 2 other brothers were 15 & 16 while
							the oldest girl was 18. The 3 oldest children were somewhere else in the Ukraine. We
							didn't know that Ana had any siblings when we went to see her in Kerch. At this
							time (February 2002) we are uncertain as to our future course in this regard. We
							might go back to the Ukraine and adopt Maxim this summer. We also asked the director
							of the Kerch orphanage to find out where the other kids were at. I think we may try
							to help them in some way. We'll have to see how things go with Ana. We can only do
							so much and have to consider our marriage and current children first.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Update:</b> (December 2002) With all of the disturbance caused by 9/11, the consulting business
							took a big hit resulting in fewer contracts for me (a consultant). We lived on
							savings for almost 8 months until I found another contract. The result was that
							we weren't able to go back and adopt Maxim.
