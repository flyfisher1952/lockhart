						<h2>
							Zac
						</h2>
						<p>
							Zachary a is 6' 4" basketball enthusiast who is dealing with brain
							cancer. He was diagnosed in June of 2011 with a glioma astrocytoma after suffering
							severe balance problems while trying out for the school basketball team. The doctors
							<img src="images/zac.jpg" style="border: 0; height:18%; float: left; padding: 10px;" alt="Zachary Cole Lockhart" />
							told us that it was terminal and that he'd live about a year. Traditional chemotherapy
							wouldn't work because of the location of the tumor and radiation would likely only
							buy him a year or less of life with the possibility of severe side effects, also because of the
							location of the tumor. We looked for alternative treatments and found the
							<a href="http://www.burzynskiclinic.com/" target="_blank">Burzinski Clinic</a> in
							Houston, Texas. Their treatment is targeted at the genes whose dormancy enable cancer
							to thrive. The treatment stimulates those genes back into activity and has had good
							<img src="images/Zac.MCBBTeam.20070104.jpg" style="border: 0; height:18%; float: left; padding: 10px;" alt="Zachary Cole Lockhart" />
							success treating various cancers, especially nerve related cancers like Zac's.
						</p>
						<p>
							He began therapy in early July of 2011 and saw a 25% reduction in the size of his
							tumor within 3 months. His tumor is a low
							<img src="images/Zac-dec-2011.jpg" style="border: 0; height:18%; float: right; padding: 10px;" alt="Zachary Cole Lockhart" />
							grade/slow growing tumor that doctors think has been with him for 6-7 years. They also think that 
							it experienced a change and became more aggresive which caused the sudden onset of more sever
							symptoms. The aggresive part of the tumor is what was killed in the first 3 months. Because the rest of 
							it is slow growing, the Burzinski folks think that it will also be slow going. He's been very upbeat about 
							the whole affair and has handled it much better than his parents. 
						</p>
						<h4>Latest Update (October 2014)</h4>
						<p>
							He endured 2 years of anti-neoplastin therapy with the Burzynski clinic
							and has been off therapy for over a year and a half. His tumor was reduced by 50% (including the first 25%)
							and is considered in remission. There has been no change in it size wise since about a year into the therapy.
							
							He is currently serving a mission to the Tempe, AZ mission.

							He entered the MTC in Provo on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of October.
