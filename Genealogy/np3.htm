I was raised<BR>thinking that Chester Hattervig was my grandad, and only found out that he was<BR>my grandmother's 2nd husband after I joined the Church and started doing<BR>genealogy.<BR><BR>My mother got in touch with her aunt (Francis Alley) and grandmother (Flora<BR>Mae) when we moved to California.  We used to visit them in Chula Vista near<BR>San Diego.  I later learned that we had once come to visit when he was mowing<BR>his lawn.  He lived across the street from Aunt Francis who cared for her<BR>mother (Flora) in their home.  When we were getting out of the car, mom walked<BR>over to talk to him (Wilcox, her dad, our grandad).  He turned and walked into<BR>his house, slamming the door.  He then forbid his son Charles from visiting<BR>his Aunt (Francis) while we were there.<BR><BR>This infuriated Francis' husband who we called Uncle Al even though his name<BR>was Corwin Clarence (he went by CC or Al) who forbid Wilcox from entering his<BR>house, effectively barring him from visiting his mother.  Aunt Francis still<BR>has a rather low opinion of him.  I talked to her the other day (26 Dec 1996)<BR>and when I asked about him, she said, "You didn't miss much."<BR><BR><HR  NOSHADE SIZE=2>
